# About

JavaServer Faces technology simplifies building user interfaces for
JavaServer applications.  Developers can build web applications by
assembling reuseable UI components in a page; connecting these
components to an application data source; and wiring client-generated
events to server-side event handlers.  This project provides information
on the continued development of the JavaServer Faces specification.

JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a [JCP Standard](http://jcp.org) technology
for authoring component based user interfaces on the
[Java EE](https://github.com/javaee/) platform.  This particular GitHub
project hosts the
[official JSF specification issue tracker](https://github.com/javaee/javaserverfaces-spec/issues).
There are three implementations of the JSF specification, all of them
developed with OSI approved Open Source licenses.

* [Eclipse Mojarra](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.mojarra)
* [Oracle Mojarra](https://javaserverfaces.github.io)
* [Apache MyFaces](http://myfaces.apache.org)

# Current Status

* JSF 2.3 is the designated user interface standard for
  [Java EE 8](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=372).  It went final on 17

* JSF 2.2 is the user interface standard for
  [Java EE 7](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=342") The most recent
  major release of JSF is 2.2.  This release occurred on 21 May 2013.
